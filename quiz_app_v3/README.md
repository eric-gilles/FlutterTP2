# quiz_app_v3

This project is a Flutter application that displays a quiz with questions and answers. The user can choose between two answers (yes or no) for each question. The application displays the progression of the quiz, the score, and allows the user to restart the quiz.

It's the third version of the quiz application of the [TP1](https://github.com/eric-gilles/FlutterTP1/tree/main/quizz_app), using the `BLoC` package to manage the application state.
